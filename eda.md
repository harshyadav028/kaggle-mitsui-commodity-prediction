# EDA Summary

_Generated from `00_eda.ipynb`_

> **Note:** No dataset files were successfully located/loaded. The EDA markdown will summarize notebook cells and detected analysis steps instead.

## Datasets detected

- None detected via straightforward read patterns.



## Visualizations detected in notebook

- histogram


## Recommended next steps (concise)


- Handle missing values: impute or drop depending on column importance and missing %.
- Encode categorical variables (one-hot or ordinal encoding) before modeling.
- Scale numeric features if using distance-based models (StandardScaler/MinMax).
- Investigate top correlated pairs for multicollinearity; consider PCA or feature selection.
- If a target was inferred, examine class balance and consider resampling (SMOTE/undersample) if imbalanced.
- Create visualization artifacts (histograms, countplots, boxplots, correlation heatmap) as needed to validate assumptions.


## What I could not do

- Load external data that is referenced via URL or not present in the environment. If you want, upload the data files or place them under `/mnt/data/` and rerun.
